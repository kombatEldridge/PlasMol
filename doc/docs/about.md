# About PlasMol

PlasMol is developed for simulating plasmon-molecule interactions, blending classical electromagnetics (Meep) with quantum RT-TDDFT (PySCF-based).

## History
- Started as a flat codebase for hybrid simulations.
- Evolved to modular structure with packages for quantum, meep, drivers, etc.
- Key discussions: File organization, relative imports, packaging with `__init__.py`.

## License

## Acknowledgments
- Libraries: PySCF, Meep, NumPy.
